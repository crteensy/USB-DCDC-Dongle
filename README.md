# USB-DCDC-Dongle
A simple USB dongle that hosts a DCDC converter to get +/- 5V from USB

BOM:
- Isolated DCDC converter, SIP-7 with 5 pins
- 2 SOT-523 Schottky Diodes
- CUI_DEVICES_SJ-43514-SMT-TR 4-pin Audio jack
- JST XH S3B-XH-A header

PCB
- 2 layers
- must be 2 mm thick for a better fit in the USB slot. 1.6 mm does work, but falls out easily especially if the slot has seen a lot of use before.
- ENIG finish (and optionally hard gold for the USB contacts)
